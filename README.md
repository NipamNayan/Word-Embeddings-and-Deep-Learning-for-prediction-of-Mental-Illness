# Word-Embeddings-and-Deep-Learning-for-prediction-of-Mental-Illness
It is a Natural Language Processing Project on Reddit tweets. The Task of Anorexia Prediction was performed on unstructured data using Word Embeddings and algorithms such as Multi-Channelled Deep-Convolutional Neural Networks were implemented after preprocessing multiple chunks of data. Other Machine Learning models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost etc were also implemented. The data was taken from ‘eRisk 2019: Early risk prediction on the Internet’, an annual International Competition. The initial data was in XML format.
